#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering 

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Sofware engineering is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products. Software enginnering is important n the technology industry for it enables the creation of software applications nd systems that power various aspects of modern life. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The milestones include, the development of programming languages for example Fortan. 
There was the establishment of sofware engineering as a discipline in the 1960s 
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The sofware development life cycle consists of several phases, the first is the requirement phrase that involves gatering and documenting user needs. Design is the secong phrase tat involves the creation of high level and detailed designs of the sofware articheture. Implementation is the third stage that comprises of writing codes and buiding software. deployment is the nect stage that involves releasing the software tothe customers and the last stage is maintance that just provides ongoing support to the software.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall is the sequentilaapproach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a watefall while the agile involves iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility collaboration and rsponding to change.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for writing codes and implementation of software projects 
A qyality assurance enginner ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans. 
A project manager oversees the planning, execution and deliveey of software projects. 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing while VCS are software tools fpr tracking changes to source code and coordinate work among team members.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Some of the challenges faced by a software enginner are changing requirements due to the rapid development cycle, tight deadline is also another challenge that develops as a result of tight deadlinesand comprimises on quality


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves individual compenenys in software.
integration testing involves testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System testing isseen as testing the entire softaware system.
Acceptance testing involves testing software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI model
is the process of crafting precise and effective prompts to guide AI models in generating desiredÂ outputs.With prompt enginnering there is efficiency and enhanced accuracy.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt, tell me about children. An improved prompt would be, tell me about the six stages that a child can be involved in when it comes to growth and development.
